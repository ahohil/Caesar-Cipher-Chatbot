    "## Cipher Bot\n",
    "\n",
    "This program creates a chat bot, known as cipher bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of this program is to allow the user to interact with a chatbot that will encrypt any phrase or sentence in English that they input, and return the encrypted response using the Caesar Cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter 3 spaces in order to encrypt the user's sentence or phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running all of the cells in order, and the user runs the last cell, cipher bot will ask the user what they want to encrypt. The user can put in any statement, whether it's a question, sentence, exclamation, etc., and cipher bot will call functions that each do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Strip the statement of its punctuation, so cipher bot can focus on encrypting the \n",
    "    letter characters in the user's statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) Lowercase all of the letters in the user's statement because the cipher_dictionary \n",
    "    only consists of lowercase letters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Uses the Caesar Cipher, which was used to create cipher_dictionary, to encrypt the \n",
    "    user's message by assigning each letter to a letter in the alphabet that's 3 letters\n",
    "    ahead of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the message has been encrypted, cipher bot will show the user what his or her original message was without the punctuation, and what their encrypted message looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, cipher bot will prompt another question asking the user if he or she wants to encrypt anything else. Every time the user answers \"yes\", cipher bot will ask what they want to encrypt, call the same functions as before to encrypt his or her statement, and ask if they want to encrypt anything else. However, if the user answers \"no\", this prompts cipher bot to say \"Have a nice day\" and exits the program."
