# Caesar Ciphor Chatbot
This project creates a chatbot that encrypts user input with any statement that he or she enters using the caesar ciphor. First the punctuation is removed, all letters are defaulted to lowercase, and the caesar ciphor is applied (each letter becomes the letter 3 places in front of it in the alphabet). The chatbot returns the message to the user.
